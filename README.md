# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose of analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze weather data obtained from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) to present an application to users that would recommend possible vacation spots based on their preffered weather. To this end, we added descriptions to the generated maps as well as input statements to filter the data for the user's weather preferences, which were then used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user will be able to choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the [Google Maps Directions API](https://mapsplatform.google.com/), we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map for accessibility.
